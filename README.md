This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React framework for production. It leverages Firebase for authentication and data storage, providing a robust platform for building scalable web applications.

## Features

- User Authentication with Firebase
- Task Management System
- Responsive Design
- Modular and Reusable Components

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Firebase account and project setup

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application
  - `components/`: Reusable React components
  - `config/`: Configuration files
  - `contexts/`: Context API for state management
  - `app/`: Next.js pages and API routes
